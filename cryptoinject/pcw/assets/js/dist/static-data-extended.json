This gives them an inherent market value, as any business or individual wishing to bring information to your attention non-organically has to pay you with AMPs for it.Value The AMP is unlike any other cryptocurrency, as it is backed by a commodity for which there is always demand and that can be purchased only with AMPs - the attention of its users.<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.synereo.com\/2015\/03\/27\/how-amps-work\/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about Synereo’s crypto-token, the AMP, and why it has an inherent use and value on the Synereo network.<\/a> Value Appreciation As users join the network, AMPs become more effective in acquiring attention. A similar amount of AMPs on the more mature and larger network will allow a piece of content to reach the attention of more users on it, increasing the value of each AMP.As well, a larger user base generates more interaction and content in circulation, increasing the total amount of attention  allocated to, and available on, Synereo.As Synereo functions as a platform for new applications and markets, AMPs may eventually become a de-facto currency.Extensibility Synereo enables a new wave of distributed applications that piggyback on the social platform and its user base.  Music streaming, content distribution, distributed marketplaces, collaborative platforms, and many other applications  can all take advantage of Synereo’s fully decentralized and distributed technology and deploy systems that truly benefit both  businesses and end users while removing the need for any middleman.Synereo is open-source and very modular, designed for rich extensibility.

You don't have to become an expert to create your decentralized application.Synereo aims to become the go-to platform for decentralized applications.They're building a framework for the decentralization of the Internet. Synereo will:Continue developing the open-source building blocks of this new decentralized paradigm.Develop in-house applications that benefit from decentralization.Work with third parties to bring their own innovation to the platform.Develop SDKs and powerful APIs for developers. Synereo has a fully operational, complete peer-to-peer stack.Synereo is built from the ground up on top of a distributed implementation of the applied π-calculus, the premier mathematical formalism developed  to reason about concurrent and distributed computations in a secure manner.This dramatically reduces development time and the level of technical expertise required, and dramatically increases the quality of implementations.Synereo has a powerful smart contracting engine. Nodes on the network can coordinate and enter binding agreements without requiring a central mediator or enforcer. It becomes simple to build decentralized, structured financial instruments as well as verify any type of distributed protocol.The Social Platform They've developed a decentralized social platform to provide the basic components of identity creation, communications, and reputation management to every application built on top of Synereo.These are shared across the entire ecosystem to service any app and are necessary especially in lieu of a central authority;  a decentralized Uber would have to rely on reputation to provide assurance to potential clients.A decentralized jobs market could rely on existing profiles, groups and reputations.Applications may integrate their streams into the unified feed provided to Synereo social network users.The feed is prioritized using our attention economy model and allows users to interface with apps from one comfortable location. Each application serves as another portal in the Synereo social network and ecosystem.Who's Building On Top of Synereo? LivelyGig: a decentralized jobs market.

            "technology": "Synereo AMPs: A Voice Amplifier AMPs, Synereo’s tokens, serve as a way to Amplify the flow of information in the network, increasing its ability to propagate to peers.They work in two ways:A user may Amplify his own posts: status messages, pictures, created events, etc. Depending on the amount of AMPs used, the post will gain greater visibility in the stream of his Synereo friends - and in adjacent, connected areas of the network through them. A user may also Amplify his friends’ posts in such a manner, helping to propagate the friends’ messages. Thus, a group of friends may band around a common interest and Amplify it together, making sure it is heard as it reaches more of their collective Synereo.  The originator of Amplified content will receive a portion of the AMPs invested by his peers. Another small portion will be used for the maintenance of the platform; people donating their storage and bandwidth to the network. The majority of AMPs will go to those who are exposed to the content, compensating them for their time and attention.Advertisers may use AMPs to created sponsored messages, reaching target audiences based on their interests and activity on the network. NOTE: A user of the system may always opt-out of receiving messages from specific advertisers, about specific topics, or altogether. Most of the AMPs used to advertise to you will be paid to you directly. This is a way to gain from your participation in the network and from the value you generate for it. The more you participate, the more the network is familiar with you and your interests, and the more influence you have on the network, the more your attention is worth! Advertising on SynereoFacebook’s revenue for Q4 2014 was $3.85 Billion. This is the sum of money that was spent for Facebook content visibility alone, and does not account for resources invested in the creation of the content being advertized or the middlemen optimizing this process.This grand economy relies on us - the users of the social network - in its entirety, but we do not share in its gains. Advertisers on these  networks are not happy campers, either. The advertising platforms, along with the service providers, are profiteering middlemen that take a major cut for supplying your attention to them.How is advertising on Synereo different? Synereo users are a real part of the advertising ecosystem rather than merely existing as pawns on someone else’s playing board. The advertisers’ funds do not remain in the hands of major corporations, but are delivered straight to potential customers around the globe as a form of compensation for their attention.Synereo enables a two-way relationship between advertisers and prospects. Advertisers can target specific communities, contributing AMPs to causes, organizations or projects - and the people that enable them. On the other hand, an advertising campaign initiated by a popular  charity or cause can maintain minimal advertising spend while relying completely on \"crowdsourced\" AMPing by its supporters.Synereo’s information flow logic greatly benefits advertisers who have committed to content excellence, increasing the spread of content engaged with by users recognized for their curation abilities and positive influence on the network; their ability to contribute to the attention economy underlying Synereo.Similar to real-world viral campaigns, a well planned advertising effort would target influencers of the relevant topics and audiences to the campaign with excellent content that, if appreciated, will be distributed on Synereo organically rather than by “brute forcing” it with AMPs.The lesser the quality of the content you see, the more you will be compensated for it!",

Traders with short time horizons, especially those using automated or algorithmic approaches, will thus have to devise new strategies to trade Amples.Ultimately, unique trader behavior in response to the protocol’s incentives is expected to produce a step-function-like movement pattern with lower correlation to Bitcoin than existing digital assets.

ROCKZ offers a ‘safe harbor’ for their wealth when the seas get rough.INSTITUTIONAL CRYPTO INVESTORS AND FUND MANAGERS - Institutional investors are increasing their participation in this new asset class. For both short and long term trading, they require a mechanism to pause between periods of investment activity.CORPORATES, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PRIVATE INVESTORS - ROCKZ is designed for corporations investing directly for their own account, and service providers acting on behalf of their clients, as well as private individuals who wish to receive payments in cryptocurrencies, but are unwilling to take the market risk related to main coins. All are looking for ease and convenient availability in the collection of their payments, while still maintaining the security and stable values of their assets. Again, ROCKZ suits all of their needs perfectly.CRYPTO-TRADERS - Crypto traders systematically make several deals a day, or week, depending on their trading style. As was mentioned above, these users need an instrument that allows them to fix positions fast and switch to new target searches. Currently, traders use Tether, being under counterparty risks, or Bitcoin, being under market risks. ROCKZ is constructed to avoid both of these risks. Long term investors share the same problems – and the same solution.ROCKS platform features two Tokens:ROCKZ, a stable cryptocurrency backed by Swiss Francs, the most stable national currency which has been steadily strengthening for more than 30 years. Rockz claims that for every issued ROCKZ, 1 Swiss Franc is held by the ROCKZ company for the coin holders’ account.Alprockz (APZ) tokens are ERC-20 tokens issued by Alprockz AG during the ICO.

            "description": "The original ARCH whitepaper focused on the concept of controlling the flow of information within a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC) in an effort to promote financial stability and growth within a DAC and protecting sensible information. While most cryptocurrencies are created as an alternative to bitcoin, ARCH was created as a startup holding DAC whose equity is represented by a cryptographic token. The goal is to test new applications of blockchain technology as well as to model an investor-token relationship in a use-case scenario involving a real startup with palpable products and services. To improve equity fungibility, revenue from any of the holding company's products or services is to be used to purchase more tokens from the market, thereby making the holding DAC's equity token exponentially more valuable with each additional revenue stream. Although no substantial revenue has been injected into ARCH's fungibility yet, its tiered conditional access levels have created a natural self-audit system that has proven very effective when it comes to managing this pseudo-corporate setup and its investors. Value in information is trusted to investors according to their own responsibility in the pseudo-corporate structure. In this tiered setup, the amount of tokens held serves as a basis of evaluating trust and involvement with the DAC itself. This system promotes unbiased transparency by the developers and corporate responsibility on behalf of the investors. This system alone, without any major revenue stream, has already proven itself as the backbone of the current stable growth in the ARCH equity token's market cap.This unique approach opens doors for a new generation of DACs, fusing decentralized communities with traditional corporate structures using tiered conditional access levels to secure the flow of information. Although tailored to our specific ventures and “community” needs, the ARCH wallet concept is an outstanding, first-of-its-kind example for other future DACs looking to combine all relevant information and tools regarding the DAC's and its equity token in one place. ARCH is taking that concept even further and seeks to integrate the whole corporate structure into its wallet as the DAC grows. In a nutshell, Arch rearranged how investors interacted in DACs to establish healthier lines of communication while changing the financial structure so that FIAT revenue would be injected directly into the tokens fungibility instead of being distributed through dividends.Their products, services and software are inspired by bitcoin, disruptive and innovative but not interdependent.",

The unique parent-child chain architecture of Ardor, with a single security chain providing energy-efficient proof of stake consensus for multiple transactional “child chains,” enables three fundamental advantages – reduced blockchain bloat, increased scalability, and the ability to launch and host ready-to-use interconnected blockchains.ARDR tokens are used to secure the network through a process called, “forging.” Since all tokens have been distributed and the supply will never increase, “forging” nodes are rewarded from the transaction fees in each block of transactions. The advanced features and functionality available on Nxt were implemented on the public and permissionless Ignis child chain – along with new features such as lightweight contracts, account and asset controls, and composite phased transactions. Businesses can launch dApps and services using the features available on Ignis such as issuing and trading digital assets, launching voting systems, and leveraging distributed cloud storage.Alternatively, businesses and developers can pick from these features, launch their own child chain, and simply plug into the security provided by the decentralized Ardor parent chain’s network using the innovative “bundler” system. Bundlers are nodes that collect transaction fees in the native child chain token, while paying with ARDR tokens to send the child chain transactions for validation on the parent chain. Five custom bundler templates are built-in to the platform to enable app and child chain owners to sponsor the transaction fees for only their intended end-users, eliminating the need for users to directly interface with the blockchain.",

Instead, all inter-zone token transfers go through the Cosmos Hub, which keeps track of the total amount of tokens held by each zone. The hub isolates each zone from the failure of other zones.

The purpose of AVT is to fuel the Aventus ecosystem and ensure that the protocol runs autonomously, de-centrally, and without any fraud. AVT is used for stake weighted voting and consensus mechanisms for voting on the legitimacy of:Events on the protocol (e.g. the global pool of verified events) => fraudulent events mean applications selling their tickets will lose customers, so we need to prevent this.Applications (either promoters or ticketing apps) sitting on top of the protocol => a list of verified applications needs to be determined so applications falsely claiming to use the protocol cannot sell fraudulent tickets.The parameters that determine how the protocol works, e.g. event creation fees or reporting fees.It is also used to facilitate anonymous matching of buyers and ticket sellers in the secondary market. “Matchers” are like miners in the Ethereum\/Bitcoin blockchains and get rewarded with new AVT for performing these computations. The winning “matcher” for a given ticket (like the winning miner of a given block) is chosen by an AVT stake-weighted probability distribution.Aventus finished their ICO on the 6th of September in under 10 minutes.

ABC supporters used a burst of rented hash power to create the illusion of an early lead, whilst the Bitcoin Cash SV miners used their own genuine investment in mining hash to provide a dominant lead before the hard fork and a consistent level of support since then. Since ABC’s artificial early lead, the Bitcoin Cash SV chain has gained ground. On November 25, the BCHSV chain significantly led ABC as the longest chain, at times over 30 blocks ahead. Bitcoin Cash SV also reduced ABC’s lead in accumulated Proof of Work to a 26% margin (down from over 55% just a few days ago). Thus, the hash war was trending exactly as CoinGeek predicted, with SV’s sustained hash prepared to outlast and eventually overtake “rented” or subsidized hash for ABC.",

As with any new invention, there can be improvements or flaws in the initial model however the community and a team of dedicated developers are pushing to overcome any obstacle they come across. It is also the most traded cryptocurrency and one of the main entry points for all the other cryptocurrencies. The price is as unstable as always and it can go up or down by 10%-20% in a single day.Bitcoin is an SHA-256 POW coin with almost 21,000,000 total minable coins.

            "features": "Mobile payments made easy Bitcoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two step scan-and-pay. No need to sign up, swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. All you need to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).Security and control over your money Bitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf. So long as you take the required steps to protect your wallet, Bitcoin can give you control over your money and a strong level of protection against many types of fraud.Works everywhere, anytime Just like with email, you don't need to ask your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites. No problem there; they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!Fast international payments Sending bitcoins across borders is as easy as sending them across the street. There are no banks to make you wait three business days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount you can send.Choose your own fees There is no fee to receive bitcoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Most wallets have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 bitcoin.Protect your identity With Bitcoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost just like with physical money. You should however take note that some effort can be required to protect your privacy.",
            "technology": "Balances - block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography.Transactions - private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining.Processing - mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.",

This type of token is best suited for sophisticated, highly risk-tolerant token holders who understand and are comfortable with taking on the risks inherent to inverse tokens like BTCSHORT and understand the risks associated with holding tokens generally and inverse products in particular.BTCSHORT offers a notional exposure to -1x the daily performance of Bitcoin. It is crucial that all token holders understand how compounding and the daily rebalancing of the token affects performance, especially in volatile markets. The tokens are designed for holding periods of equal or less than one day and holders need to consider their holdings each day.",

It is a brand of open-source software based on the as blockchain technology as used by Bitcoin. Unlike bitcoins, which do not produce any income for their owners, BitShare can be used to launch Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs) which issue shares, produce profits and distribute profits to shareholders. As such, BitShares is about making profitable companies that people want to own shares in, thus creating return for the shareholders. The first DAC launched by this proces was called BitSharesX, a decentralized asset exchange based in Hong Kong. BitShares was originally launched under the name of ProtoShares (PTS); it was later renamed to BitShares (BTS) and \"reloaded\" in November 2014 by merging several products into BitShares (BTS).   ",

            "technology": "Delegated Proof-of-Stake ConsensusDelegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is a new method of securing a crypto-currency’s network. DPOS attempts to solve the problems of both Bitcoin’s traditional Proof of Work system, and the Proof of Stake system of Peercoin and NXT. DPOS implements a layer of technological democracy to offset the negative effects of centralization.Delegated proof of stake mitigates the potential negative impacts of centralization through the use of witnesses (formaly called delegates). A total of N witnesses sign the blocks and are voted on by those using the network with every transaction that gets made. By using a decentralized voting process, DPOS is by design more democratic than comparable systems. Rather than eliminating the need for trust all together, DPOS has safeguards in place the ensure that those trusted with signing blocks on behalf of the network are doing so correctly and without bias. Additionally, each block signed must have a verification that the block before it was signed by a trusted node. DPOS eliminates the need to wait until a certain number of untrusted nodes have verified a transaction before it can be confirmed.This reduced need for confirmation produces an increase in speed of transaction times. By intentionally placing trust with the most trustworthy of potential block signers, as decided by the network, no artificial encumbrance need be imposed to slow down the block signing process. DPOS allows for many more transactions to be included in a block than either proof of work or proof of stake systems. DPOS technology allows cryptocurrency technology to transact at a level where it can compete with the centralized clearinghouses like Visa and Mastercard. Such clearinghouses administer the most popular forms of electronic payment systems in the world.In a delegated proof of stake system centralization still occurs, but it is controlled. Unlike other methods of securing cryptocurrency networks, every client in a DPOS system has the ability to decide who is trusted rather than trust concentrating in the hands of those with the most resources. DPOS allows the network to reap some of the major advantages of centralization, while still maintaining some calculated measure of decentralization. This system is enforced by a fair election process where anyone could potentially become a delegated representative of the majority of users.",

For instance, say that you want to create $10,000 of BVOL. To do so you can send in $10,000, and the BVOL account on FTX buys $10,000 worth of FTX MOVE contracts. Thus, BVOL is now 1x long MOVE.You can also redeem BVOL tokens for their net asset value. To do that, you can send your $10,000 of BVOL back to FTX, and redeem it. This will destroy the token; cause the BVOL account to sell back the $10,000 worth of MOVE contracts, and credit your account with $10,000.This creation and redemption mechanism is what ultimately enforces that the leveraged tokens are worth what they're supposed to be.",

The Bytecent project was conceived to bring sanity back to an industry that has drifted away from the core principles set forth with the original Bitcoin project.Bytecent is not just another digital currency in a sea of many; it is a philosophy born out of necessity. The goal of this project is to reinvent digital currencies from the manner that wallets are distributed and installed, to the method that coins are earned and spent. Bytecent is the first user-friendly digital currency designed from the ground up to be as easy as sending an email. If you can point and click a mouse, you can use Bytecent.Bytecent is the first user-friendly digital currency designed from the ground up to be as easy as sending an email. If you can point and click a mouse, you can use Bytecent. Unlike with other digital currencies, Bytecent does not require any special hardware or configurations to mine. Simply download the software, install it, and begin mining today! \"Mining\" is lingo for discovering new Bytecent, similar to panning for gold. In actuality, mining is simply the process used to verify Bytecent transactions on the network.There are approximately 1440 coins generated per day, so finding new Bytecent can take a few hours or a few days depending on the speed of your computer. Mining Bytecent is fun and allows anyone with no mining experience or technical knowhow to begin mining immediately! Similar to conventional currencies, Bytecent is a currency that can be used to buy goods and services. You can offer your goods or services in return for payment in Bytecent.",
            "features": "No Personal Information Required Unlike with credit cards and other forms of electronic payments, Bytecent does not require you to input personal information. Risk of privacy intrusion and ID theft is completely eliminated with Bytecent. Furthermore, compared to bank transactions, all you need to complete a transaction is the free Bytecent wallet and a unique Bytecent address.No Credit Checks Bytecent eliminates the need for credit checks and lengthy credit applications. Whether the end-user has excellent credit, bad credit or no credit, anyone can use Bytecent. You will never be denied or restricted from using Bytecent.Immediate Transactions Money transfer services and bank wire transfers can be costly, and transaction times can vary from a few minutes to a few days. Bytecent solves this problem by allowing anyone to send funds quickly to any person worldwide, without the hassle of dealing with banks or money transfer services. The average Bytecent transaction is completed within 60 seconds or less!No Transaction Limitations Whether you are sending 1 Bytecent or 100000 Bytecent, the amount you are sending does not matter. There are no limitations on the amount of Bytecent you can send at one time, nor are there any daily or monthly transaction limits. You have the freedom to conduct as many transactions as you desire.Unauthorized Transaction Prevention With Bytecent, you do not need to be concerned with criminals gaining access to your Bytecent address, and going on a shopping spree at your expense. The \"sender\" initiates all transactions, and transactions cannot be performed remotely by a 3rd party. Someone will need to gain access to your computer or mobile device to access your Bytecent, and even then it will be virtually impossible if you password protect your wallet.",
            "technology": "Proof of Bytecent is an innovative earning system that employs captcha technology to limit network abuses while keeping the earning process tangible. POB requires workers to enter a human readable captcha code every sixty minutes to maintain the earning process without interruption. POB time can be extended without entering the captcha code by storing x amount of coins in the local wallet. For example, If 25 Bytecent are required to extend POB time for one hour, a worker will need a total of 575 Bytecent stored in his\/her local wallet to extend POB time for a total of 24 hours. Bytecent utilized for POB can be used anytime and are not locked from being spent like with Proof of Stake coins. The number of coins required to extend POB time is based on numerous factors including current price, total volume, and demand.1.POB renders botnets ineffective, while dramatically reducing the effectiveness of mining farms.2.POB generates demand for Bytecent while keeping the available Bytecent in circulation low.3.Workers are rewarded by storing more Bytecent in their local wallets.4.Sell pressure from workers and merchant dumping is significantly reduced.5.Fewer Bytecent are stored on exchanges and other centralized platforms.",

            "description": "Decred is an open, progressive, and self-funding cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain. At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW\/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.Decred is built in the spirit of open participation and we have provided below a full disclosure of the technical features of the system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, project governance and development, and a group contribution timeline.Decred opted for a different funding model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project. Instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software, the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public. The consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development, due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing, whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written. We felt this was unjust.The development of Decred was funded by Company 0 and from the pockets of its developers individually. The cost of developing the project, in terms of developer pay, totals to approximately USD 250,000, which Company 0 paid to developers. An additional amount of approximately USD 165,000 has been allocated for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers. We felt that the most equitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch. The model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free - all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of USD 0.49 per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate.The premine consists of 8% of the total supply of 21 million coins, meaning the premine consists of 1.68 million coins. Rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring-up costs, we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring-up and an \"airdrop\", where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants. This means Company 0 and its developers will have put roughly USD 415,000 into the bring-up since April, 2014 and receive 4% of the total supply, 840,000 coins (at USD 0.49 per coin). The remaining 4% will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the Decred network and decentralize its distribution.  Coins held by Company 0 will be used to fund its ongoing work on open-source projects, such as Decred and btcsuite.Giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project: enlarge the Decred network, further help decentralize the distribution of coins, and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project. Decred is fundamentally about technological progress, so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms. The maximum number of airdrop participants is capped at 5,000 individuals, so we recommend registering sooner rather than later. These coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of Decred receiving anything from you in return for these coins.Sign up for the airdrop is currently open, but the airdrop registration will commence on January 4th, 2016. People who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form. This form will require airdrop participants to enter an address to which their coins can be sent. Binaries and source code will be made available so that you can generate a wallet seed and an address for your airdrop coins. Once you have entered your receiving address into the airdrop webform and submitted it, you will receive your coins on the projected launch date.",

This is done in full view of the community in a system designed to fight against ingroup-outgroup dynamics.The initial contributors are the developers responsible for btcsuite (est. early 2013 - present).A proposal for a layered form of transparent meritocratic governance that extends beyond proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms to bring forward and represent insider and outsider voices in the community.A proposal for bottom-up decision-making through the Decred Assembly, an evolving and inclusive list of community members who make non-financial contributions to the project through their work and effort.The project is bound by the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.decred.org\/Decred_Constitution\" target=\"_blank\">Decred Constitution<\/a> on the core principles of finite issuance, privacy, security, fungibility, inclusivity, and progressive development of the technology that keeps these principles together.",

For a deeper description, please consult the <a href=\"https:\/\/decred.org\/dtb001.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Decred Technical Brief<\/a>.Novel hybridized proof-of-work\/proof-of-stake (PoW\/PoS) consensus system - A decentralized lottery is used to select PoS miners to vote on PoW blocks. The PoW and PoS subsidies account for 60% and 30% of each total block subsidy, respectively. This system is based on that of MC2, which is very similar to, but developed independently from, Proof-of-Activity (PoA) by Iddo Bentov, Charles Lee, Alex Mizrahi and Meni Rosenfeld.Cold staking and decentralized stake pooling - The ability to generate new coins without the risk of having your coins online when PoS mining. The PoS mining system has also been engineered with distributed, decentralized stake pooling in mind, so that even those with small amounts of stake can participate in network validation.Internal voting system for the addition of new features and hard or soft fork selection - Both PoW and PoS miners can vote for features and issues through bit flags, providing a sensible mechanism for resolving disputes about the features of the blockchain.Immutable transaction hashes (\"transaction IDs\") by separating transaction signatures from the rest of the transaction data - A permanent fix for transaction hash malleability has been implemented that prevents mutability of the transaction hash by separating it from its input signatures. This allows more efficient SPV validation. Fraud proofs have also been added.Elliptic curve cryptography over secp256k1 with optional Curve25519 support - The Bitcoin scripting system has been modified to allow for simple, drop-in addition of new elliptical curve digital signature algorithms.Schnorr signatures with threshold n-of-n support - In addition to supporting Schnorr signatures, groups of signers can now jointly sign transactions off-chain in constant size signatures, ensuring higher privacy and less blockchain bloat.Script enhancements and new OP codes - New OP codes have been added to the existing Bitcoin scripting engine, and extensions for the plug-in use of future scripting engines have been added.PoW mining using BLAKE256 hash algorithm - Inspired by Bernstein's Chacha stream cipher, SHA3 finalist BLAKE256 offers speed as well as high security.Compatibility with Bitcoin transaction scripting system - Decred's scripting system has been derived from Bitcoin's with care in ensuring that all future updates to the Bitcoin transaction script will be easily extensible to Decred. Further, any newly created functionalities will also be devised with backwards compatibility with Bitcoin in mind.Modularized, easy-to-use Golang btcsuite codebase - Thanks the to the codebase inherited from btcsuite, adding new features to the daemon or wallet will be facile. Decred will episodically sync updates from btcsuite, so that it benefits from the latest developments in Bitcoin.Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets - Wallets use a seed to deterministically generate addresses, so your wallet can be restored from a single BIP0032 seed.Transaction expiration - Transactions have a new expiration field to prevent inclusion into the blockchain after a certain height.Patches for intrinsic Bitcoin bugs - Extra push for multisignature scripts has been removed, SIGHASH_SINGLE behavior has been corrected.Approximately 21 million coins - Exponential decay in subsidy or the number of coins generated per year.Self-funded development via block subsidy - In order to have an ongoing source of funding for development work, a consensus rule has been added to allocate 10% of each block subsidy to a development organization. This entity is transparent and responsible for funding development work performed by current and new developers so that the project remains sustainable without a funding dependence on outside forces in the future. Decred therefore improves with growth in a sustainable way and is accountable only to its users. ",

It allows consumers to acquire content for a cheaper price, while the content creators can keep 100% of the profits. Furthermore, there is no central authority that dictates what content is worth downloading, meaning that content creators are free to express themselves completely and to succeed (or fail) in their craft, regardless of what corporations or governments see fit. The reputation, recommendation, and feedback systems will give every user an equal opportunity.Decent will host an ICO starting on the 10th of September in which 70% of the DCT tokens' total supply will be sold for ETH and BTC.

It is developed and maintained by ETHDEV with contributions from great minds across the globe. There is also an Ethereum foundation and there are multiple startups working with the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum is currently on the \"Homestead\" stage and all its related software is still considered Beta until the release of the next stage \"Metropolis\". If you are looking for a GUI interface for your wallet, try the <a href=\"\/wallets\/ethereum-wallet-dapp\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum Wallet DApp<\/a>. It's still in beta so be careful when you use it.Our block explorer data bellow is freely provided by <a href=\"https:\/\/etherchain.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">etherchain.org<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/etherscan.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">etherscan.io<\/a>. ",
            "features": "Ethereum is a platform that is intended to allow people to easily write decentralized applications (Đapps) using blockchain technology. A decentralized application is an application which serves some specific purpose to its users, but which has the important property that the application itself does not depend on any specific party existing. Rather than serving as a front-end for selling or providing a specific party's services, a Đapp is a tool for people and organizations on different sides of an interaction use to come together without any centralized intermediary.Contracts generally serve four purposes:- Maintain a data store representing something which is useful to either other contracts or to the outside world; one example of this is a contract that simulates a currency, and another is a contract that records membership in a particular organization.- Serve as a sort of externally owned account with a more complicated access policy; this is called a \"forwarding contract\" and typically involves simply resending incoming messages to some desired destination only if certain conditions are met; for example, one can have a forwarding contract that waits until two out of a given three private keys have confirmed a particular message before resending it (ie. multisig). More complex forwarding contracts have different conditions based on the nature of the message sent; the simplest use case for this functionality is a withdrawal limit that is overrideable via some more complicated access procedure.- Manage an ongoing contract or relationship between multiple users. Examples of this include a financial contract, an escrow with some particular set of mediators, or some kind of insurance. One can also have an open contract that one party leaves open for any other party to engage with at any time; one example of this is a contract that automatically pays a bounty to whoever submits a valid solution to some mathematical problem, or proves that it is providing some computational resource.- Provide functions to other contracts; essentially serving as a software library.Contracts interact with each other through an activity that is alternately called either \"calling\" or \"sending messages\". A \"message\" is an object containing some quantity of ether (a special internal currency used in Ethereum with the primary purpose of paying transaction fees), a byte-array of data of any size, the addresses of a sender and a recipient. When a contract receives a message it has the option of returning some data, which the original sender of the message can then immediately use. In this way, sending a message is exactly like calling a function.",
            "technology": "Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the \"middle layers\" of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users - high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute.Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of \"net neutrality\". One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for \"off-label\" purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in \"unauthorized\" ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation).Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier - the concept of \"message\" is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including \"function call\" and \"event interesting to outside watchers\", and it is worth separating the two.Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin\/litecoin\/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like \"locktime\" feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send \"signed data packets\" and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid.Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)",

It’s not necessary to know all the technical aspects regarding Factom or Factoids to reap the benefits of this platform.Investors have been eagerly awaiting the addition of Factoids on major cryptocurrency exchanges since the conclusion of the Factom token sale. Factoids trading on crypto-exchanges are likely to generate additional interest in the Factom platform while allowing new community members to purchase some tokens for future use.In preparation for the launch of the Factoids trading market on Poloniex, the Factom team also released the binaries and installers for the project’s software client recently.

            "technology": "Will Factoids have their own blockchain?Ultimately Factoids will be implemented on their own Chain in Factom. For the crowd sale, other options are possible.How are Factoids created?Two ways. Factoids will be created as a part of the crowd sale. Secondly, Factoids will be created at a fixed rate and paid to the Factom Servers and Audit Servers for their work running the system, and to pay other incentives.Is there a separate Proof of Work or other consensus mechanism for factoids, independent of factom?No. That said, the Factom chain and the Entry chain are managed by the Factom Servers (they are the application using these chains) so they validate them in real time. No invalid entries can be placed in these chains.How do factoids get sent back to the protocol? Is it a kind of burn?  No. The Entry Credits are burned. Entry Credits are non transferable. They can only be used to buy entries. But when they DO buy entries, the Factoid in the protocol that was used to buy the Entry Credits is released. The amount of Factoids varies since the price of Entry Credits per Factoid varies.  The Factoid paid out is calculated by dividing the total number of Factoid in the protocol by the number of outstanding Entry Credits.  The number of Factoids in the protocol and the number of outstanding Entry Credits are all computable from the Entry Chain and the Factoid Chain.  ",

Staking was designed originally to yield a percentage of a coinholder's total coins over time, every year, in exchange for supporting the network. Developers walk a fine line between coding high interest percentages to entice holders to stake to support the network while trying to keep the interest percentages low enough that inflation doesn't kill the coin. People have become accustomed to 'Mining Periods' of hyper inflation where the initial coinbase is established, after which mining becomes impossible and the network relies entirely on holders to stake in order to maintain the network and process transactions. Genstake aims to change all that. With Genstake, staking blocks doesn't give you interest on the coins you already have; staking blocks gives you a full block reward. Effectively, each of your coins becomes a little mining rig on the network, working diligently to mine you more coins. Gone are the days of 0.02 coins for staking a block. Staking a block with Genstake produces 20 Gencoins. ",

The Telegram Open Network is being designed to host a new generation of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. It is a fast, flexible and inherently scalable multi-blockchain architecture that consists of a masterchain and accompanying blockchains (workchains). Broadly speaking, TON can be regarded as a new decentralized supercomputer and value transfer system.By combining minimum transaction time with security and scalability, TON aims to become a VISA\/Mastercard alternative for the decentralized economy, with an already established a massive user base to help kickstart the project.

Additionally, the built-in sharding mechanism found in TON, further divides these workchains into shardchains. Mainly, what allows the TON Blockchain to securely process millions of transactions per second is the infinite sharding paradigm and the Instant Hypercube Routing mechanisms. The Infinite sharding paradigm sees TON’s blockchains divided into shardchains in which each block consists of a collection of the state and state transitions of several accounts and smart contracts. This means that users can keep parts (shards) of a specific blockchain and still interact with them, lifting the load of regular nodes, and allowing for growth while still maintaining decentralization.While the Infinite sharding paradigm allows TON’s workchains to be divided into shardchains, the Instant Hypercube Routing allows these chains to communicate updates in account or smart contract states, ensuring that an action by an account can affect other accounts in different shardchains.

These are roasted on a pan together with onions and butterfat. The dish is often seasoned with salt, pepper, marjoram, cumin, and parsley, and served with a fried egg or kraut (cabbage). Hence, gröstl is somewhat similar to the American dish called hash. The letter ‘ö’ was replaced by ‘ø’, which is a letter in the Danish alphabet that is pronounced in the same way as ‘ö’. This way, the name, like the hash function itself, contains a mix of Austrian and Danish influences. The pronunciation of Grøstl may seem challenging. If you think so, then think of the letter ‘ø’ as the ‘i’ in \"bird\".

            "technology": "About the algorithm:- Is an iterated hash function, where the compression function is built from two fixed, large, different permutations. The design of Grøstl is transparent and based on principles very different from those used in the SHA-family.The two permutations used are constructed using the wide trail design strategy, which makes it possible to give strong statements about the resistance of Grøstl against large classes of cryptanalytic attacks. Moreover, if these permutations are assumed to be ideal, there is a proof for the security of the hash function.- Can and is accelerated by the hardware AES support present in most modern Intel CPUs, which helps reduce the efficiency gap between a CPU and other implementations. Groestl (old GPU\/CPU) - Groestl makes wide range of trade-offs between throughput, latency, and power consumption. Because of this, groestl uses less power per hash than other algos. Due to the less complex hashing, groestl performs well on older GPU’s as well as CPU’s.- Is the single most efficient algorithm for GPUs in the cryptocurrency market. It has been shown to have the lowest power consumption, heat and noise of recently released algorithms, allowing for a quieter and more effective mining environment. - Is set to be the future of mining, Groestlcoin is proud to be the first to utilize this new efficient algorithm.- Is a recently proposed cryptographic hash algorithm that has common structure and features with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The objective of this paper is to present the design of a high speed joint implementation of Grøstl and AES with minimal resources using a pipelining method. The advantage of this implementation is that it efficiently provides both cryptographic hash function and block cipher. The system is targeted to the Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. The paper presents a complete description of the design and implementation, as well as an analysis of the resulting synthesis and comparison to other proposed implementations of the Grøstl hash function.- Is a byte-oriented SP-network which borrows components from the AES. The S-box (substitution-box) used is identical to the one used in the block cipher AES and the diffusion layers are constructed in a similar manner to those of the AES. As a consequence there is a very strong confusion and diffusion in Grøstl.- Is a so-called wide-pipe construction where the size of the internal state is significantly larger than the size of the output. This has the effect that all known, generic attacks on the hash function are made much more difficult.- Has good performance on a wide range of different platforms and counter-measures against side-channel attacks are well-understood from similar work on the AES.About the AES acceleration:The compression function f is based on a pair of 256- or 512-bit permutation functions P and Q, and is defined as:f(h, m) = P(h ⊕ m) ⊕ Q(m) ⊕ hThe permutation functions P and Q are heavily based on the Rijndael (AES) block cipher, but operate on 8×8 or 8×16 arrays of bytes, rather than 4×4. Like AES, each round consists of four operations:1.AddRoundKey (the Grøstl round keys are fixed, but differ between P and Q)2.SubBytes (this uses the Rijndael S-box, allowing sharing with AES implementations)3.ShiftBytes (expanded compared to AES, this also differs between P and Q, and 512- and 1024-bit versions)4.MixColumns (using an 8×8 matrix rather than Rijndael's 4×4)Grøstl divides the input into blocks and iteratively computes hi = f(hi-1, mi). However, Grøstl maintains a hash state at least twice the size of the final output (512 or 1024 bits), which is only truncated at the end of hash computation.",

A small portion of the revenue is cycled back into the collective to further increase the collective's application catalogue, which in turn increases the token value and revenue payouts.GeoFounders tokens, also known as GeoUnits (GUNS), serve multiple purposes. The first purpose is to act as a measurement of “virtual stake” regarding revenue produced by the GeoFounders software catalogue. GUNS tokens are analyzed using a simple formula due to the fixed nature of the GUNS supply. For every GUNS token a person possesses, they receive 0.0000009% of the revenue generated by the GeoFounders software collective. The more tokens you possess, the greater your share of the revenue.The second purpose of GUNS tokens are to act as a verification mechanism within different GeFounder applications. Depending on the software, this authentication process can provide different services. For example, the primary GeoFounder members application uses token verification to allow communication within the software while other applications provide novelty software rights, such as the ability to name an in-game location within GeoRealms if you can verify an account with 1000 or more GUNS.",

It's compounded every block, so the rate is approximately 5% APR. However, remember there is a maximum of 30 days, so to get that APR, you'd need to log in each month and shuffle the HODL to a new address.2. Bonus Interest RatesTo encourage early adoption, astronomical rates of interest are paid in the early months. The max rate is 0.0000152587890625 (1\/2^16). Compounded, the rate is 2174%. It's reduced every block by a multiplier - calculated like this =((409530-X)\/409530)^4 (X is the block where the balance is recorded as an output).To calculate your bonus rate, you can use this formula.Principal + (Standard Interest + (Bonus Interest * Bonus Multiplier)Bonus ratesDay  0 ~ 2174%Day 30 ~ 1881%Day 60 ~ 1543%Day 90 ~ 1317%..Day 660 ~ 0.230% APRDay 690 ~ 0.029% APRDay 730 ~ no bonus3. Term Deposit BonusIf you lock an amount of HODL as a term deposit, you can also get a bonus on the interest. The longer the deposit, the bigger bonus. The bonus is just a multiplier of the interest, so if you locked up 100 HODL for 1 year, you'd expect a return of 5 HODL. The term deposit bonus for 1 year is about 100% - so at the end of the term you'd have 110 HODL (Capital 100 + Interest 5 + Term Deposit Bonus 5). See the chart for the multipliers, or use this formula - =(1-((409530-X)\/409530)^6)*100  (X is the number of blocks to lock for, min 2 days, max 1 year)So to calculate your full bonus return on a term deposit . . . it'sPrincipal + ((Standard Interest + (Bonus Interest * Bonus Multiplier))*Term Deposit Multiplier)Term deposit Rates1 week term deposit ~ 5.6% bonus on interest1 month term deposit ~ 22% bonus on interest3 month term deposit ~ 55% bonus on interest6 month term deposit ~ 82% bonus on interest1 year term deposit ~ 98% bonus on interestn.b.

It has a proven track record and is here to stay. Many newer cryptocurrencies are no longer supported. Stable ServiceMinimal footprint and reduced memory requirements provide a stable wallet and mining platform. Continuous updates mean you will always have the latest improvements in service and security. Fully DecentralizedDecentralization means there are no single points of failure, so you have minimal hiccups or service disruptions. The I0coin network is always ready for business… or fun, 24\/7. Ultra Low InflationWith over 99% of its 21 million coins already in circulation, I0coin has one of the lowest inflation rates of any digital currency. Inflation will reach zero out to two decimal places by 2018. Block Chain PruningPruning allows users to set the size of the block chain stored locally, which frees up disk space for other uses. Thin clients also allow for minimal web hosting costs for sites using I0coin. I0coin's specifications were chosen to provide the optimal balance across a broad spectrum of users. It's well balanced whether you're making a purchase, mining, or investing. The wallet requires only 425 MB of memory (fully synced). Its quick 90 second transaction confirmations make it excellent for making purchases, without being so fast as to sacrifice security. I0coin can be mined essentially for free since it is merge mined with Bitcoin. The maximum number of coins is permanently capped at 21 million, so you never need to worry about inflation devaluing your coins. This makes I0coin a great long term investment.

For instance, say that you want to create $10,000 of BVOL. To do so you can send in $10,000, and the BVOL account on FTX buys $10,000 worth of FTX MOVE contracts. Thus, BVOL is now 1x long MOVE.You can also redeem BVOL tokens for their net asset value. To do that, you can send your $10,000 of BVOL back to FTX, and redeem it. This will destroy the token; cause the BVOL account to sell back the $10,000 worth of MOVE contracts, and credit your account with $10,000.This creation and redemption mechanism is what ultimately enforces that the leveraged tokens are worth what they're supposed to be.",

The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-proof Directed Acyclic Graph, with no fees on transactions & no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second in the network. Instead, throughput grows in conjunction with activity in the network; the more activity, the faster the network. Unlike blockchain architecture, IOTA has no separation between users and validators; rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization. IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT). For a more in depth look at the technical design of IOTA read their <a href=\"https:\/\/iota.org\/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf\">https:\/\/iota.org\/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf<\/a>. ",
            "features": "Micro transactions For the first time ever true micro and even nano-transactions are enabled due to the unique IOTA Tangle architecture, providing developers with a brand new set of tools for their applications in both IoT and Web. This nurtures brand new business opportunities for companies that prohibitive fees has kept in the realm of the impossible until now.Data transferCore feature of IOTA is the ability to transfer data through the Tangle. IOTA gives you several options to do so, making it possible to establish secure and authenticated communication channels between devices. All data which is transferred through IOTA is fully authenticated and tamper-proof - making attacks impossible.Voting Although IOTA is uniquely suited for the Internet-of-Things, the Tangle enables a variety of different use cases that involve secure data transmission, especially for eGovernance. An important part of this sector is e-Voting. The exploration into this field of use-cases has already begun by several companies and academics.Masked messagingAs the first extensible module of the IOTA core, MAM enables nodes to exchange data through the Tangle, fully authenticated and encrypted. This means that your devices can transmit valuable and sensitive data with quantum-proof security through the Tangle, ready to be analyzed later. MAM makes it possible to share data with multiple parties easily, similar to a radio, multiple parties can simply tune in on your frequency and get the broadcast data. Leasing anything with a ChipWhile the whole world has adopted the ‘Sharing Economy’ in areas like driving and accommodation, IOTA enables a whole new realm where anything with a chip in it can be leased in real time. Most of our belongings stay idle for the vast majority of time that we possess ownership of it, but through IOTA a lot of these things like Appliances, Tools, Drones, eBikes etc. and resources such as computer storage, computational power, WiFi bandwidth etc. can be turned into leasing-services effortlessly.",

LynxCI installs the latest stable release of Lynx along with the full historical blockchain history of the project which includes over four years of transactional data. LynxCI also installs a mining software package that allows the device to mine the Lynx HPoW coin. Through solo mining, the software allows the node to actively participate in the Lynx network by creating and confirming transactions on the network in the mining process. LynxCI is intended to be used on computers with relatively limited RAM and processing power (such as Raspberry Pi 3), but it can also be used in cloud VM environments.Technology:Basic Coin Parameters1. 30-second block time2. Cost of a transaction is .0001 Lynx\/kilobyte3. 1-week block reward maturity for miners4. 1 Lynx block reward plus feesThe Lynx code includes the DigiShield difficulty adjustment algorithm. This enhancement better ensures the 30-second block-time average and provides support for low-hash, eco-friendly mining rigs to mine blocks after a high-powered mining rig leaves.",

            "description": "IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger protocol that goes 'beyond blockchain' through its core invention of the blockless ‘Tangle’. The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-proof Directed Acyclic Graph, with no fees on transactions & no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second in the network. Instead, throughput grows in conjunction with activity in the network; the more activity, the faster the network. Unlike blockchain architecture, IOTA has no separation between users and validators; rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization. IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT). For a more in depth look at the technical design of IOTA read their <a href=\"https:\/\/iota.org\/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf\">https:\/\/iota.org\/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf<\/a>. The total supply of IOTA is (3^33 - 1) \/ 2 = 2,779,530,283,277,761 tokens. This value is optimized for ternary computation - it is the largest possible 33-digit <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ternary_numeral_system\">ternary number<\/a>:111,111,111,111,111,111,111,111,111,111,111 (base-3) = 2,779,530,283,277,761 (base-10)The total IOTA token supply was \"minted\" on the genesis transaction and will never change. It is now impossible for anyone to \"mint\" or \"mine\" new IOTA tokens.IOTA uses the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_System_of_Units\">International System of Units<\/a> (or SI units):",
            "features": "Micro transactions For the first time ever true micro and even nano-transactions are enabled due to the unique IOTA Tangle architecture, providing developers with a brand new set of tools for their applications in both IoT and Web. This nurtures brand new business opportunities for companies that prohibitive fees has kept in the realm of the impossible until now.Data transferCore feature of IOTA is the ability to transfer data through the Tangle. IOTA gives you several options to do so, making it possible to establish secure and authenticated communication channels between devices. All data which is transferred through IOTA is fully authenticated and tamper-proof - making attacks impossible.Voting Although IOTA is uniquely suited for the Internet-of-Things, the Tangle enables a variety of different use cases that involve secure data transmission, especially for eGovernance. An important part of this sector is e-Voting. The exploration into this field of use-cases has already begun by several companies and academics.Masked messagingAs the first extensible module of the IOTA core, MAM enables nodes to exchange data through the Tangle, fully authenticated and encrypted. This means that your devices can transmit valuable and sensitive data with quantum-proof security through the Tangle, ready to be analyzed later. MAM makes it possible to share data with multiple parties easily, similar to a radio, multiple parties can simply tune in on your frequency and get the broadcast data. Leasing anything with a ChipWhile the whole world has adopted the ‘Sharing Economy’ in areas like driving and accommodation, IOTA enables a whole new realm where anything with a chip in it can be leased in real time. Most of our belongings stay idle for the vast majority of time that we possess ownership of it, but through IOTA a lot of these things like Appliances, Tools, Drones, eBikes etc. and resources such as computer storage, computational power, WiFi bandwidth etc. can be turned into leasing-services effortlessly.",

Transaction confirmations are fast due to the 60 second block time and the difficulty retargetting is every block based on DigiShield. The one percent premine is used in the Nautlius stabilisation fund to ensure liquidity in the market.As pointed out by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q3 “The Economics of Digital Currencies”, Bitcoin faces three challenges: 1) Volatility 2) Sustainability of Low Transaction Fees 3) Limitations of a Fixed Money Supply. Nautiluscoin was designed to address and eliminate the challenges faced by Bitcoin.he Nautiluscoin Stability Fund seeks to reduce volatility, while the Proof of Stake algorithm does away with the need for expensive mining equipment. Additionally, at the heart of the Proof of Stake reward calculation is an algorithmic monetary policy that adjusts money supply with demand.The Nautiluscoin economy is built on the foundation of a strong currency policy and the view that a strong economy requires a currency which preserves purchasing power. Creating a fertile environment for an economy to develop requires the continuous pursuit of stability. But the pursuit of stability is not just about reducing daily price fluctuations.For Nautiluscoin to be truly successful it must preserve and increase purchasing power. Daily price stability is important for consumers and merchants to transact, but the long run success of any currency is a function of purchasing power. If users of a currency believe that their ability to purchase goods and services in the future will be diminished then they are less likely to hold and use the currency. Therefore the most important goal for Nautiluscoin will be to maintain a strong currency with a stable and growing purchasing power.In order to accomplish its strong currency goal, Nautiluscoin will compete with economics. Traditionally central banks with a strong currency policy are charged with providing an anchor for the economy through the use of money supply targets, interest rate targets, and\/or exchange rate targets. Economic history has shown that these targets require the central bank to have significant resources in order to credibly accomplish the targets. Most successful targeting policies rely on an unlimited resource which is classically the ability to print or borrow money. In the case of Nautiluscoin, the terminal money supply is fixed by the software code and there are not public debt markets to use as an interest rate targets. However, this does not mean it lacks arrows in the quiver.Because the terminal money supply is fixed and released over time we have the ability to set the growth rate of the money supply. As well, the Nautiluscoin network will be secured through proof-of-stake method which will pay interest to those who desire to hold Nautiluscoin. Finally, the mining process allows us to support the exchange rate by using mining profits to purchase Nautiluscoin.  ",

In addition, since it doesn’t require awarding all coins to miners, it enables distribution of the cryptocurrency in any way the coin creator deems to have the highest strategic value for the growth and adoption of the coin - a true blank slate.NeuCoin will be open, accountable and ultimately controlled by coin holders. NeuCoin’s core code development, user growth programs, and projects to increase utility will be supported by three non-profit foundations based in Isle of Man: the Code, Growth and Utility foundations. All foundations are ultimately controlled by NeuCoin holders (1 NeuCoin = 1 vote), who have the power to hire, fire and set compensation for the foundations’ Council Members, and have a right of approval on annual budgets, spending priorities and other matters. This structure makes NeuCoin more decentralized and accountable than Bitcoin, Ripple or Stellar, let alone most of the anonymous alt coins out there.Three billion pre-mine allocation:- 2.4 billion held by the three non-profit foundations-  - 0.2 billion - Code foundation-  - 1.4 billion - Growth foundation-  - 0.8 billion - Utility foundation- 0.2 billion retained by team for $1 million of work invested (restricted for use or sale)- 0.1 billion sold to initial seed investors for $250,000 (restricted for use or sale)- 0.2 billion sold to strategic angel investors for $1 million cash invested (restricted for use or sale)- 0.1 billion pre-sold to users in the crypto-community for BTC 4,012 (unrestricted for use or sale)<a href=\"http:\/\/www.neucoin.org\/en\/whitepaper\/download\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"NeuCoin whitepaper\">NeuCoin whitepaper<\/a>",

            "technology": "Innovative Proof-of-stake TechnologyNeuCoin’s proof-of-stake design solves the mounting cost and increasing centralization problems faced by proof-of-work systems. In addition, since it doesn’t require awarding all coins to miners, it enables distribution of the cryptocurrency in any way the coin creator deems to have the highest strategic value for the growth and adoption of the coin - a true blank slate.Strategic Coin DistributionTo make a cryptocurrency viable, consumers, the service providers that make it useful, and buyers are all critically important. To incentivize participation by all these actors, NeuCoin’s non-profit foundations will award coins to each constituency in proportion to the value they bring to NeuCoin. Besides achieving the fairest possible distribution of the cryptocurrency, this design also maximizes its long-term value. To optimize for growth and adoption, a large share of the foundations’ endowment will be given to consumers in exchange for engaging with, trying out, and referring friends to NeuCoin. Another large block will be awarded to companies that help NeuCoin grow its user base and become more useful: game publishers and content providers that accept microtransactions with NeuCoin tokens, exchanges, wallets, consumer mining services, payment processors, remittance services, discounted group shopping services, marketing and distribution partners and other key services to NeuCoin users. Finally, some will be sold, with proceeds used by the foundations to increase the value of NeuCoin through consumer marketing, utility development, and core coin development.Offering Consumers Something Useful to Do For consumers to want a cryptocurrency, they have to be able to do something with it that they can’t do better with traditional payment methods. From the very day that the cryptocurrency launches, NeuCoin will offer more utility and consumer-friendly services than most cryptocurrencies: free NeuCoin tokens through an engaging website, an easy online wallet and a web-based mining service that lets consumers grow their coins without ever having to even see the word “mining” or any other tech jargon. To keep incentivizing third party companies to constantly develop more services and utility, the NeuCoin Utility Foundation will pay large bounties to integrate with service providers that make it more useful: game publishers and premium digital content providers (#1 priority) exchanges (#2 priority, in all geographic markets), payment processors, wallets, and international remittance providers.Rolling Out Microtransaction SolutionsMicrotransactions may be the killer app of cryptocurrency, giving consumers access to new types of commerce not viable with traditional payment methods, such as <$1 transactions for playing or leveling up a casual game, tipping, pay-per-view, ad-free content, tiny amounts of work or advice, small donations, etc. To quickly build utility in this key strategic area, NeuCoin is developing two prototype online\/mobile games based on popular, generic games that will demonstrate how NeuCoin can be incorporated into game experiences - giving out free NeuCoins as a reward for playing, winning, leveling up, etc. Having a meaningful userbase of NeuCoin-holding players will be an important leverage point as we work with leading game publishers with large exisiting user bases to integrate NeuCoin. NeuCoin has also entered partnerships with leading players in the online video, music and artist promotion spaces to develop microtransaction platforms for tipping and paid premium content. These pilot partners will help optimize user experience, conversion and monetization, after which the platforms will be rolled out to additional content providers in the music, video, photo, blog, social media publishing, adult, podcast and other areas.Freemium Marketing to ConsumersIn today’s digital economy, offering a free entry-level service is key to easing consumers into a new consumer experience. After having a positive first experience some users will buy more, or find ways to earn more. This has been a critical success factor for growth and conversion for premium consumer services like Dropbox, Skype, Viber, Whatsapp, Spotify, Candy Crush Saga. NeuCoin’s distribution strategy enables it to fuel its marketing with freemium tokens (giving users a few free NeuCoin to get started). This minimal friction is key for user adoption. NeuCoin will put a heavy focus on conversion-driven marketing, with game-like tutorials and interactive onboarding that qualifies, educates and rewards users - with no tech to read or understand and no personal information or money down to get started. Finally, social referral programs will reward free NeuCoin tokens to people who help recruit other users; special programs and bounties will be available for people active in the crypto community, influential bloggers and content creators, celebrity endorsers, etc.Rewarding Early Adopters People who get in early on NeuCoin - who help create the first core of users and holders - will be highly rewarded for adding this value. NeuCoin’s economic model uses very high PoS awards, starting at 100% per year in year one, 80% in year two and gradually declining to 6% by year ten, meaning that coin holdings will multiply by up to 50X over 10 years with non-stop PoS mining.Transparency and GovernanceNeuCoin will be open, accountable and ultimately controlled by coin holders. NeuCoin’s core code development, user growth programs, and projects to increase utility will be supported by three non-profit foundations based in Isle of Man: the Code, Growth and Utility foundations. All foundations are ultimately controlled by NeuCoin holders (1 NeuCoin = 1 vote), who have the power to hire, fire and set compensation for the foundations’ Council Members, and have a right of approval on annual budgets, spending priorities and other matters. This structure makes NeuCoin more decentralized and accountable than Bitcoin, Ripple or Stellar, let alone most of the anonymous alt coins out there. ",

Although innovative in its nature, the Obits Tokens were sold off market prior to December 2015 from the creator, CCEDK, and allocation during the Genesis block - after the first of December OBITS is gradually being released onto the market. That said the Crypto Asset\/Token is essentially a pathway to gaining exposure to the nascent crypto space.The Obits token denominates ownership in a profit sharing arrangement between various organisations such as Openledger, CCEDK exchange, Biteaser advertising platform & ShareBits. At the time of writing only openledger is actively contributing towards the Obits Token profits. Please see the technology page to understand more about how openledger profits are generated and used to buyback obits.All transactions made on the platform are verifiable on the blockchain. Any user can therefore audit the profits generated by the company in real time. Since the blockchain ensures full transparency, unlike conventional banking systems, stakeholders and shareholders will be able to ensure they are not being cheated. This will also add a novel dimension to share trading as it will allow for real time disclosure of Company revenues.The Obits buyback program will occur at regular intervals, just like government bond auctions, with the first in February 2016. The idea is that out of the 18,276,898 issued at launch the profits will then be used to reduce the number of coins in supply - like a traditional stock buyback if the number of shares is reduced then the value of each share will be increase. The opposite could be true too with dilution taking place if the network of Companies involved decides to add other Companies to its network and justify it with the addition of further OBITS. As it is a essentially a stock crossed with an affiliate agreement depending on the future profits of a group of companies - there is high levels of risk involved. But again an innovative and novel idea as in most jurisdictions the heavy compliance costs for widows and orphans investments have been bypassed in a crowd funding manner using Crypto Asset Technology based on Bitcoin.",

The buy-back option is possible at OpenLedger only, taking into consideration features of all other financial assets and the annual inflation rate, which reduces the true income of investors (thought to be at least 10% per year).Profits generated from referral programsWhether for OpenLedger, OBITS or any other account involving any of the projects mentioned, these fees will be added in full (100%) to the value of OBITS.OBITS uses a new approach to increase investors’ capital and the value of this token\/cryptocurrency. Destruction of tokens purchased at buy-back will implicit cause the appreciation of the remaining tokens. You can find out more here.Token owners can lock in their profits by selling their OBITS at Openledger or other participating exchanges, using the order book..",
            "technology": "TechnologyThe BitShares platform itself is run and maintained by the BitShares community–an open consortium of individuals and organizations committed to providing universal access to the power of smart contracts.Working together, this community has designed and developed the BitShares platform to include numerous innovative features which are not found elsewhere within the smart contract industry:Price-Stable Cryptocurrencies - SmartCoins provide the freedom of cryptocurrency with the stability of the dollarA SmartCoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to that of another asset, such as the US Dollar or gold. SmartCoins always have 100% or more of their value backed by the BitShares core currency, BTS, to which they can be converted at any time at an exchange rate set by a trustworthy price feed. In all but the most extreme market conditions, SmartCoins are guaranteed to be worth at least their face value (and perhaps more, in some circumstances). Like any other cryptocurrency, SmartCoins are fungible, divisible, and free from any restrictions.Decentralized Asset Exchange - A fast and fluid trading platformBitShares provides a high-performance decentralized exchange, with all the features you would expect in a trading platform. It can handle the trading volume of the NASDAQ, while settling orders the second you submit them. With this kind of performance on a decentralized exchange, who needs risky centralized exchanges?Industrial Performance and Scalability - Graphene is capable of 100,000 TPS when we pay for the network to go with itHigh performance blockchain technology is necessary for cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms to provide a viable alternative to existing financial platforms. BitShares is designed from the ground up to process more transactions every second than VISA and MasterCard combined. With Delegated Proof of Stake, the BitShares network can confirm transactions in an average of just 1 second, limited only by the speed of light.Dynamic Account Permissions - Management for the corporate environmentBitShares designs permissions around people, rather than around cryptography, making it easy to use. Every account can be controlled by any weighted combination of other accounts and private keys. This creates a hierarchical structure that reflects how permissions are organized in real life, and makes multi-user control over funds easier than ever. Multi-user control is the single biggest contributor to security, and, when used properly, it can virtually eliminate the risk of theft due to hacking.Recurring & Scheduled Payments - Flexible withdrawal permissionsBitShares is the first smart contract platform with built-in support for recurring payments and subscription payments. This feature allows users to authorize third parties to make withdrawals from their accounts within certain limits. This is a convenient way to “set it and forget it” for monthly bills and subscriptions.Referral Rewards Program - Network growth through adoption rewardsBitShares has an advanced referral program built directly into its software. Financial networks derive their value primarily from their network effect: more people on the same network increases the value of that network for everyone. BitShares capitalizes on this by rewarding those who sign up new users, and does so in a fully transparent and automated way.User-Issued Assets - Regulation-compatible cryptoasset issuanceThe BitShares platform provides a feature known as \"user-issued assets\" to help facilitate profitable business models for certain types of services. The term refers to a type of custom token registered on the platform, which users can hold and trade within certain restrictions. The creator of such an asset publically names, describes, and distributes its tokens, and can specify customized requirements, such as an approved whitelist of accounts permitted to hold the tokens, or the associated trading and transfer fees.Collateralized Bond Market - Integrated peer-to-peer lendingThe BitShares bond market is an investment marketplace accessible to anyone with an internet connection. In the bond market, you can earn interest with any asset, or take a short position using any other asset as collateral. (Coming Soon)Stakeholder-Approved Project Funding - A self-sustaining funding modelBitShares is designed to be self funding and self-sustaining by giving the stakeholders the power to direct where blockchain reserves are spent. BitShares has a reserve pool of 1.2 billion BTS (about $8 million dollars) that automatically grows as transaction fees are collected and the share price rises. Each day, the blockchain is authorized to spend up to 432,000 BTS (about $77,000 per month), which is enough to hire a small team to maintain the network for years, even with no price appreciation.Transferable Named Accounts - Easy and secure transactionsNamed accounts enable users to easily remember and communicate their account information. We don't use IP addresses to browse the internet or numbers to identify our email, so why shouldn't we have human-friendly account names for our financial transactions?Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus - A robust and flexible consensus protocolDelegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All network parameters, from fee schedules to block intervals and transaction sizes, can be tuned via elected delegates. Deterministic selection of block producers allows transactions to be confirmed in an average of just 1 second. Perhaps most importantly, the consensus protocol is designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference.",

Security and user experience are the first thoughts behind any update or code modification. The addition of the word \"cash\" was made to give it direct inclusion into the financial sector and to communicate the whole concept in a word: \"OKCash\".Anybody who hears this word gets an overall concept or general idea of what it is about. OK is the technology while OKCash is the first application of this technology, being the coins we can send or put in our wallets for saving, spending or sharing. OKCash's rebranding was done in April 2015, and since then the OK cryptocurrency has been added to one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges - Bittrex.

This reflects the OKCash focus on developing relationships with other cryptocurrencies, through charitable initiatives and collaborative projects with other coins, which so far have included projects with Gaia, Einsteinium (EMC2) and others.Another important point to be highlighted regarding OKCash is the fact that there has not been any problems so far with the block chain or it’s code and it runs in real fast and reliable network.The custom wallet designs reflect an attention to detail and an importance of visual design that is unique to OKCash, along with its emphasis on positivism, inclusiveness and to further the advancement of all the cryptocurrency environment adoption and decentralized payment systems, while bringing back trust to Crypto and becoming The Future of Social Payments.Uses:  Spending, Sharing, Saving, Remittance, Social Tipping, Crowdfunding, Promotion, Bitcoin Support, Education, communications and much more to be discovered.",

OMC plans to be a major inflation and investment vehicle for the cryptocurrency community as well as various brick-and-mortar entities.Taking the first step towards an unbanked societyThe core principle of Omicron's investment platform is to allow investors to own a digital asset that adds value to itself- just like shares in a dividend-issuing company. Easily transferable for a quick turnover without the need of intermediary brokers, the OMC asset will be the choice dividend vehicle for investors around the globe. Biweekly dividends ensure that no matter the price of the asset, the asset owner always will receive a 0.00001% share of the dividend pool, per Omicron, every 2 weeks.How are BTC dividend-yields accrued and issued?BTC dividends will be funded every 2 weeks through trading on the volatile altcoin market as well as lending capital for margin-trading exchanges (stable interest). The loan interest guarantees a biweekly issuance of dividends, while the altcoin trading revenue is a major bonus, many times greater than loan yields. The trading yields aren't guaranteed biweekly as there may be an occurrence where there is a net loss during the timeframe. A minimum balance of 10,000 OMC in an address will be required to qualify for dividend yields. A BTC address must be associated with the OMC address, which will be done through the main website, and soon through the Omicron client itself.",

The quick turn over on exchanges will make OMC a superior investment vehicle than any existing dividend-issuing company today. Issuing dividends at a faster rate than most businesses, the market will be fast paced and a choice asset to trade as daytraders make their moves on dividend performance. As OMC adds value to itself through continuous dividend payouts, long term holders of the asset will experience a steady increase to the value of their investment as well as pocketing biweekly revenue.",

Fullstack developers will be paid and employed to implement said features. The main focus of Omicron is to provide a suitable and superior investment vehicle than dividend-issuing companies. With this in mind, there will be no brand new technical developments made for OMC. Modifications will be ported from other cryptocurrency clients to keep OMC top of the line.",

Each block creates 5 new accountsUsers can't create accounts by themselves. Unless the user is a miner and creates a block. Users can only create public\/private keys to operate with accounts. Users can also have someone with an extra account send one to their public wallet key.Crypto keys (Public key\/Private key) are not part of the address like Bitcoin, keys are used as a personal password to operate with your accounts (like a password PIN), wallets can also be locked with a password.Due to the White Paper explained concept, historical transactions can be deleted, but there will always be some nodes with all historical transactions to check consensus on the blockchain.",

The PHB token which is based on the Binance Chain and the PHX token which is based on the NEO blockchain. Below there is a short explanation on how the dual-token system will work.The integration will consist of the launch of a new BEP-2 token called PHB, native to the Binance Chain ecosystem, and subsequent migration of NEP-5 PHX tokens on Binance.com to BEP-2 PHB tokens, which will then be tradable on both Binance.com as well as Binance DEX, the new decentralized exchange feature developed on top of the Binance Chain blockchain. Binance users who hold PHX on Binance.com will automatically have their PHX tokens migrated to PHB, and the exchange will continue to support the deposit of both PHX and PHB, while allowing for withdrawals in PHB. The total token circulating supply of PHX + PHB will remain the same as before, ensuring continuity and transparency in regards to our market-driven token price and market cap.At the same time, the existing NEP-5 PHX token will continue to be natively supported by the Redpulse.com platform. Red Pulse continues to be closely partnered with NEO and its pioneering blockchain infrastructure that has allowed Red Pulse to develop our smart contract-based Phoenix infrastructure: Proof of Creation, Proof of Ownership, Regulatory Compliance, IP Protection, and Accountability. Via this Phoenix infrastructure, intellectual property such as research notes and whitepapers can be registered, secured, and tokenized as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and transferred between parties. As the Binance Chain continues to mature, Red Pulse will develop an identical infrastructure on the BEP-2 protocol as well.Learn more about the Red Pulse integration with the Binance Chain <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.red-pulse.com\/red-pulse-integrates-with-binance-chain-de9b5cf37030?source=collection_home---4------3-----------------------\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.Visit the Red Pulse Phoenix NEO-based token page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptocompare.com\/coins\/phx\/overview\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.  ",

In the first phase there is a filtering layer which is applied by a machine using AI (RAF & Tone Analyzer utilities), and then a second layer is applied by the company to either decide if the review is accepted or not. This mechanism also allows saving part of a review in an RSS smart contract (Review snapshots storage) making reviews immutable.The Revain platform, differently from other blockchains will have two tokens, the R token, and the RVN token. The R token will be used to gather funds during the ICO and to exchange it for other cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, the RVN token will be used exclusively inside Revain platform, to reward users\/companies for quality reviews and to penalize those who write unconstructive reviews. A fixed value of 0,0001 Bitcoin is attributed to the RVN token, enabling RVN tokens to be converted for the R tokens within the platform.

If she doesn’t cover the budget herself, she then begins a traditional crowdfunding campaign. Donations are received and within thirty days the minimum threshold is reached or the funds are returned. Once the threshold is reached, the project is again reviewed and confirmed. If necessary, the project founder is notified that any permits or other legal permissions are needed from the state or appropriate parties. The total budget for the project is 87% of total donations. 3% is reserved for credit card and handling fees, 10% goes to direct purchase of ROOTS tokens on the open market, increasing token demand. 87% is a higher project spend rate than most charitable organizations are capable of delivering, and in line with major international organizations. When everything is confirmed and ready to go, RootProject assigns a project foreman – a paid employee or contractor – and a budget for materials, tools and labor, aiming to hire a team that can finish the project in one day, if reasonable.

Users all over the world contribute disk storage from their computers to form a decentralized network.Anybody with siacoins can rent storage from hosts on Sia. This is accomplish via \"smart\" storage contracts stored on the Sia blockchain. The smart contract provides a payment to the host only after the host has kept the file for a given amount of time. If the host loses the file, the host does not get paid.The distrubuted nature of the Sia network enables many optimizations in latency, throughput, reliability, and security. The decentralized nature of the Sia network enables anyone with storage to get paid, lowering the barrier to entry and reducing the overall price of cloud storage.The Sia cryptocurrency is live! You can rent storage using siacoins and hosts providing storage to the network receive compensation in the form of siacoins. The storage platform itself is still in beta, and only uploads that are 500mb or less in size are supported by the wallet.",
            "features": "Sia uses a new cryptocurrency, called the siacoin. The developers will mine the first 100 blocks or so before releasing the code + miner to the public.  Other than these first blocks, there is no premine for siacoins. The first block reward will be 300,000 siacoins. Each block reward after that will be one siacoin smaller than the previous block reward (299,999, then 299,998, and so on). When the block reward reaches 30,000, all remaining blocks will give a 30,000 siacoin reward. The block time is 10 minutes. Each siacoin is composed of 10^24 indivisible units.The most important features of Sia can only be accessed by using siacoins. All storage contracts and all Sia payment channels require owning siacoins. This requirement means that as Sia grows in usage, so too will demand for siacoins. As demand grows, the price will increase. If Sia is being used for billions of dollars of storage, billions of dollars of siacoins will be required. The value of the siacoin is inextricably tied to the amount of storage in use on the Sia network.Sia has a second cryptocurrency, called the Siafund. 3.9% of all successful storage contract payouts go to the holders of the siafunds. There are 10,000 siafunds total, and all 10,000 are completely premined. Sia's parent company, Nebulous Inc., holds approximately 8750 of these siafunds. The remaining siafunds were sold in a crowdfund which helped to finance Sia's early development. The primary goal of siafunding is to provide a way to finance the development of Sia without relying on donations or a premine. More people using Sia means more funding available to hire more developers.Standard transactions are not subject to the fee, and neither are failed storage contracts (where the host was offline or lost the file).",
            "technology": "The foundation of Sia is a proof of work blockchain. Storage contracts are a new type of transaction that get enforced by the blockchain. Sia's hashing algorithm is blake2b. p2pool and multisig wallets are both supported on Sia.  When a file is uploaded to Sia, a storage contract is created containing the Merkle root of the file, a reward for the host, and a penalty for the host (both in siacoins). After an agreed-upon duration, the host is required to prove that the file is still available by providing a random Merkle proof. If the proof is valid, the host is rewarded; otherwise, the host is penalized.  Random numbers are generated deterministically using the most recent block as a seed.Sia has support for two way payment channels, and two way contract diffs.  Among other things, this provides massive scalability, and eliminates the need for untrustworthy 0-confirmation transactions. Once you join a payment channel network, all transactions within that network will be instant and final, with no risk of a double spend.Reliability is achieved by using erasure coding in a massively distributed environment. Erasure coding allows a file to be split into many pieces, such that the original file can be recovered using only a few of them. For example, you can take a 50 MB file, break it into 200 pieces that are 1 MB each, and then you can recover the original file from *any* 50 of the pieces. This method has the same overhead as creating 4 complete copies of the file, yet is much more reliable because it's much less likely that 151 out of 200 hosts will go offline than it is that 4 out of 4 hosts will go offline.As the network grows, we will apply statistical analysis to determine the redundancy required to provide 99.9999% reliability on files. It is likely that 3x overhead is absurd overkill, and statistical analysis will give an accurate picture of how much overhead is required.Using 200 hosts to store a file means that downloads can be massively parallel. Even if the average Sia host does not have quick upload speeds, the massive parallelism enabled by Sia means that downloads will be blazing fast anyway.  In addition, you can choose to connect only to the datacenters that are the closest and the fastest. This optimization (known as a CDN) is a hugely expensive project for a traditional cloud storage service, but for Sia it is a natural consequence of the decentralized network.As security is a top priority of Sia, all encryption is performed locally; the people storing your files will have no ability to see what you have uploaded.  Not only is every file encrypted separately, every *piece* of every file is encrypted separately, and hosts are not told which pieces are part of the same file.",

SHA256d is easier on CPUs during syncronization and bootstrap because it requires only two hashes to verify a block whereas X11 requires 11 hashes.The early part of the Synergy PoS period makes use of Turbo Stake, which awards Synergy holders greater interest for every stake. The multiplier is directly used in the reward calculation by multiplying it with the base Synergy interest rate of 10% per year.Holders build the Turbo Stake multiplier over two days by staking consistently. After that, the multiplier will level out and the holder will stake with a consistent rate that depends on how much stake competes with his.

Users can use steem power to upvote content and get curating rewards.When a user upvotes content his steem power gets depleted and then slowly regenerated. Steem Power holders recieve interest from their holdings. The more Steem Power a voter has the more revenue he'll generate for himself (in form of SP) and for the content creator  (In SBD).There is also an incentive to upvote content early, as the rewards are distributed according to time. The earliest votes gets the biggest share of the reward.Steem Backed Dollars are there to protect content creators from volatitlity and can be traded for roughly 1 usd worth of steem, in order to cash out from steem. Converting Steem backed dollars into STEEM takes 5 days. Users also recieve interest from holding SBD. TSteem is a proof of work currency with a scheduled blocktime of 3 seconds. Steem PoW mining is done in rounds of 63 seconds by 21 miners (witnesses). 19 of the miners are pre voted, one is the other with the most computational power, and the last one is selected from a queue of witnesses that did not get on the top 19 voted witnesses.90% of the block reward is allocated to a vest fund to reward curators and PoW miners, the other 10% are made liquid in the form of steem and are used to reward content creators.

To buy USDQ at the exchange is the first way by means of which it is possible to get stablecoin.The 2nd way, which includes several important elements of an ecosystem, is receiving the credit in the stablecoin USDQ through crypto assets collateral. A pledge rate to the released stablecoin is D %, where D is the last rate established by Q Box which is a self-learning neural network, and approved by holders of the governance token. Thus, it reaches over provided credit and leads to ensuring the stability of USDQ token. Respectively, when new crypto assets enter the ecosystem, the created smart contract prints new USDQ and sends them to the borrower. When the borrower wants to take away the collateral and return the credit, it undergoes the return procedure on the website, at the same time paying a certain interest rate for use of stablecoin credit. After the return of USDQ together with payment of commission for use of proceeds of credit, crypto assets are de-frozen and return to the address of the borrower's wallet, and USDQ tokens are burned. The credit in USDQ tokens is issued for a limited term. If the credit lasts, then it is necessary to bring the commission in the governance tokens Q DAO. If the credit is not returned in time, then pledge in cryptocurrency goes to the untouchable stabilization fund. In case of elimination process crypto assets of stabilization fund are sold first.",

Therefore, rather than waiting for a new block to be mined, a state change can occur at any time, verified by a trusted player, and approved by consensus. Each separate contract maintains its own chain of state (Smart Contract Chain - C-chain), so a contract can perform actions asynchronously without blocking or affecting other contracts, and the combined changes of state collectively form a directed acyclical graph (“DAG”) that makes up the blockchain itself.UTN is the token powering Universa's ecosystem. Execution of Smart Contract actions requires transaction fees paid in UTN to reward participating nodes.

The way to make money directly through Bitcoin is to predict its future price. WCG has an innovative mechanism to allow the transaction fees to be recycled, that is, all of the transaction fees included in that block of the forging account be rewarded. For the time being, there are only three ways to generate transaction fees: arbitrary messages, WCG transfers and aliases. But as WCG adds more features, each of the WCG accounts that are forged will continue to increase. As WCG has a practical mechanism to get more new features through its voting system, it is hoped that the community would agree to add more promising new features, to correspond to the increase of transaction fees and WCG's real interest rate. By combining all these features with a scalable framework, WCG has become the foundation of a well-established and mature peer-to-peer economy.

It was developed from the previous PoS  blockchain, Xaurum (XAU) which was migrated to the Ethereum platform to lower costs and inflation associated wwith mantaining a Proof of Stake 2.0 cryptocurrency.Xaurum is gold backed crypto asset, that derives its value from the gold reserves maintained by the Auresco Institute, a non-profit organization created by the Xaurum team. Xaurum is ment to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.The former cryptocurrency, Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR. In this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the \"Goldmine\" or Mint them. When mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies is used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold. The proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself. when Minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not mantain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.Profits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself.",

            "technology": "Ring Signature The BasicsIn cryptography, a ring signature is a type of digital signature that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members' keys was used to produce the signature.For instance, a ring signature could be used to provide an anonymous signature from \"a high-ranking White House official\", without revealing which official signed the message. Ring signatures are right for this application because the anonymity of a ring signature cannot be revoked, and because the group for a ring signature can be improvised (requires no prior setup). Application to MoneroA ring signature makes use of your <a href=\"https:\/\/getmonero.org\/resources\/moneropedia\/account.html\" data-tooltip=\"similar in function to a bank account, contains all of your sent and received transactions\">account<\/a> keys and a number of public keys (also known as outputs) pulled from the <a href=\"https:\/\/getmonero.org\/resources\/moneropedia\/blockchain.html\" data-tooltip=\"a distributed ledger of all transactions both past and present, without revealing who the funds came from or went to\">blockchain<\/a> using a triangular distribution method. Over the course of time, past outputs could be used multiple times to form possible signer participants. In a \"ring\" of possible signers, all ring members are equal and valid. There is no way an outside observer can tell which of the possible signers in a signature group belongs to your <a href=\"https:\/\/getmonero.org\/resources\/moneropedia\/account.html\" data-tooltip=\"similar in function to a bank account, contains all of your sent and received transactions\">account<\/a>. So, ring signatures ensure that transaction outputs are untraceable. Moreover, there are no fungibility issues with Monero given that every transaction output has plausible deniability (e.g. the network can not tell which outputs are spent or unspent).To read how Monero gives you privacy by default (unlinkability), see <a href=\"https:\/\/getmonero.org\/resources\/moneropedia\/stealthaddress.html\" data-tooltip=\"automatic one-time addresses for every transaction\">stealth addresses<\/a>.",

Ripple is a distributed network which means transactions occur immediately across the network - and as it is peer to peer - the network is resilient to systemic risk. Ripples aren't mined - unlike bitcoin and its peers - but each transaction destroys a small amount of XRP which adds a deflationary measure into the system.",
            "features": "Math-Based CurrencyA math-based currency, also referred to as a cryptocurrency, is a digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can reliably verify gold as a substance made of atoms with 79 protons. Math-based currencies exist as digital assets in their own right and can be transferred directly between users (as fiat cash can be) without relying on a centralized protocol operator. XRP exists as a math-based currency on the Ripple protocol.Abuse ProtectionThe primary function of XRP is to protect the Ripple protocol against denial-of-service (DoS) spam attacks. Since the Ripple protocol is based around a shared ledger of accounts, a malicious attacker could create large amounts of “ledger spam” (such as fake accounts) and “transaction spam” (such as fake transactions) in an attempt to overload the protocol. This could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the protocol’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions.Bridge CurrencyXRP has great value as a bridge currency. Because each gateway’s balances trade as distinct assets within Ripple, the number of potential currency pairings can become quite large. Instead of quoting every possible currency\/gateway combination, XRP can serve as a useful bridge currency to enable these transfers. This is possible because if every currency is liquid to XRP, then every currency is liquid to every other currency:",
            "technology": "The Ledger and ConsensusThe Ripple protocol is, at its core, a shared public database. This database includes a ledger, which serves to track accounts and the balances associated with them. The ledger is a distributed database — a perfect, shared record of accounts, balances, and transactions in the Ripple protocol. It is continually and automatically updated by the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) so that an identical ledger exists on thousands of servers around the world. At any time, anybody can review the ledger and see a record of all activity on the Ripple protocol. When changes are made to the ledger, computers connected to the Ripple protocol will mutually agree to the changes via a process called consensus. The Ripple protocol reaches consensus globally within seconds of a change being made. The consensus finding process is the engineering breakthrough that allows for fast, secure, and decentralized transaction settlement on the Ripple protocol.The World’s First Distributed ExchangeNo one owns or controls the Ripple protocol. It runs on computers around the world, all working together to continually maintain a perfect, shared record of accounts, balances, and transactions. Distributed networks offer many efficiencies over centralized networks. Because the network is “self-clearing”, it eliminates the need for a centralized network operator (and gets rid of the associated layer of fees). Because there is no single point of failure, distributed networks are more reliable. They also tend to be more secure, due to their open source nature.   ",

The unique feature to Shuffle is its ability to reorder the sixteen algorithms based upon the previous block. This shuffle makes it more difficult to produce an ASIC hash.TRUST was launched on July 4, 2014. TrustPlus team rescued VOOT and used the funding to make TRUST. The launch was X11 2021 Difficulty. Initial miners were rewarded small but PoS started after seven days. The initial miners created many minters reducing the amount of large reward blocks.In January 1st, 2019 TrustPlus team changed the ticker to XTP.",

            "technology": "MasternodesMasternodes are nodes with locked collateral for their services on the blockchain to earn block rewards.Services ProvidedProof-of-Service defines Masternodes. Masternodes have services to the blockchain InstaSend and Private Send. Instasend works perfectly for sending XTP immediately. Private send allows sending with the highest amount of privacy.CollateralAn XTP masternode requires a transaction of 100,000 to a wallet address. This amount serves two purposes. The amount “locked” in a masternode reduces the total amounts of coins for sale, increasing scarcity. This collateral also creates a barrier to entry for cheap block rewards.Reward processBefore a found block, the masternodes select a winner for each block number. The Proof-of-Stake miners download the winner's list. If Miner solves the next block, they report the next block, their address, and the winning masternode address. Upon a couple of confirmations, the block is broadcasted to all nodes.

When a developer proposes a protocol upgrade, they can attach an invoice to be paid out to their address upon approval and inclusion of their upgrade. This approach provides a strong incentive for participation in the Tezos core development and further decentralizes the maintenance of the network. It compensates developers with tokens that have immediate value rather than forcing them to seek corporate sponsorships, foundation salaries, or work for Internet fame alone.WARNING:This is the price of HitBTC XTZ futures. HitBTC does not allow short-selling their futures; only previous purchasers of the futures can sell them.

The only information that is revealed regarding transactions is the time in which they take place.Block explorer data from <a href=\"https:\/\/explorer.zcha.in\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/explorer.zcha.in\/<\/a>",

            "technology": "zk-SNARKsThe BasicZcash is the first widespread application of zk-SNARKs, a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography. The strong privacy guarantee of Zcash is derived from the fact that shielded transactions in Zcash can be fully encrypted on the blockchain, yet still be verified as valid under the network’s consensus rules by using zk-SNARK proofs.The acronym zk-SNARK stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,” and refers to a proof construction where one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier.“Zero-knowledge” proofs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. For example, given the hash of a random number, the prover could convince the verifier that there indeed exists a number with this hash value, without revealing what it is. Application to ZCASHIn order to have zero-knowledge privacy in Zcash, the function determining the validity of a transaction according to the network’s consensus rules must return the answer of whether the transaction is valid or not, without revealing any of the information it performed the calculations on. This is done by encoding some of the network's consensus rules in zk-SNARKs. At a high level, zk-SNARKs work by first turning what you want to prove into an equivalent form about knowing a solution to some algebraic equations. In the following section, we give a brief overview of how the rules for determining a valid transaction get transformed into equations that can then be evaluated on a candidate solution without revealing any sensitive information to the parties verifying the equations.",
